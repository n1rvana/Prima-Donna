This is the list of "Demands" for future employers.  This isn't meant to be an inflexible list-- missing a few of these could be ok.  All of them are meant to be red flags that an employer doesn't sufficiently resect employees, or isn't going to be around long enough for equity to pay off.

Never work...
0. where you're not getting equity along with a paycheck, or where you can't ask the CFO how many shares are outstanding on a fully diluted basis, and get an answer, during your interview.

1. for a manager who is not an engineer, unless you're the CTO.

2. Think twice working for any "tech" company where the CEO is not an engineer, or technically proficient.

3. in an open office plan.

4. for a company that shows disrespect for employees in other ways. Companies try to hide so you have to look close.

5. for a company that uses cult behavior, eg: "magic phrases" like Amazon's "Today is Day One!!", or that has a management book that all employees are supposed to read (if said book is of the pop-management variety)

6. for a company that doesn't provide you a convenient parking space at their expense (you should be working remote anyway!)  Or, given your situation, a transit pass.  You shouldn't be spending an hour each day looking for parking spaces and walking to-from your space.

7. for a company that doesn't provide flex hours. 
 Flex needs to really mean flex. Midnight to 8AM should be an acceptable work schedule. Company should be operated as asynchronously as possible.

8. for any company with standup meetings, or other pointless meetings. 
  (yeah yeah, all of the previous "SCRUM" teams have been "doing it wrong", so that just means nobodies doing it "right")  You can have daily status, just make it asynchornous.

9. on a team where mandatory meetings happen more than twice a year.  
  If the meetings are worthwhile, you don't need to make them mandatory. Mandatory is short for "I am going to be wasting your time, and ratehr than have nobody show up, I'm going to force you to show up."  Mandatory safety meeting? Ok, that's one of your 2.

10. for less than 3 weeks of vacation a year

11. for a "starter" salary that will be "made up later", unless this is a startup and you're getting a significant chunk of equity- eg: shares valued at most recent round of investment, or a $1M valuation if no investment, EXCEEDS the lost income.

12. for equity with a vesting schedule with an initial cliff longer than 90 days, (30 days is appropriate)

13. for equity with a vesting schedule over 4 years (and only 4 for > %5 equity)

14. for a company that has taken money from dishonest or unethical VCs (I know a lot of the bad ones but check "the funded" for reviews)

15. for a company that doesn't hire ops engineers, but expects developers to be "on call"

16. for a company that has a lot of restrictions about vacation and doesn't treat it as real (eg: you don't get all your days when you leave, bad PTO policies, etc)

17. in any office without adequate bathrooms, this includes any buildings where people are packed like sardines. 
18. Combine the gender ratio of tech companies with more than %100 occupancy and the bathrooms are insufficient

18. in any setup with less than a dual thunderbolt display, or single 35"4k monitory.

19. on windows on a regular basis

20. where my development machine can't be a Mac

21. for a company that does drug testing on employees, or even reserves the right to do so

22.  for a company with an employee handbook that is all about protecting and absolving the company while imposing an undue burden of petty rules on the employees, including interfering with things that are none of the companies business such as alcohol consumption outside of work.

23. For a company that uses stack ranking in any form.
